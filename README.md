# FUCHA-BINS OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION
## WHAT WE DO
### REGENERATING CITY SPACES FROM PLASTIC WASTE
We plan to address the issue of plastic waste by organizing our first community project assembling and designing sustainable trash **smart bins** for the recycling of PLASTIC. **FUCHA** bins, an abbreviation for **Fedha Uchafu**, meaning **lucrative waste management** aims to transform plastic waste collected from different areas into eco-bricks for sustainable spaces. We will start with a pilot from University of Dar-es-salaam areas for starters, then move to other areas as we progress.

## OUR BELIEF
We believe this initiative will help reduce plastic waste in our environment and get us on our way to contributing towards our SDGs **8**, **11** & **13**. This will also act as a source of employment to artists and as tourism attraction. This is because of the artistic dust bins placed all over the city. 

The end goal is for the plastic collected to be recycled into regenerative products, say build classrooms/ shelters, chairs or anything that can be recycled and made out of plastic for a greater cause. Fucha Bins provides the mechanisms for it to happen.

## BUSINESS PROCESS

* FUCHA Bins physical designs **>>>** 3D model converted to NFT for operations & governance **>>>** collection of plastic **>>>** data is measured, recorded and valued on IPFS **>>>** earn plastic credits on chain **>>>** utility recyclables (e.g. plastic furniture, Eco-bricks).
     ### STARTING POINT
     * The University students organize from 5-10 **Go-green champions** who will oversee the stationing of the bins, the recycling process, learn about        plastic & carbon credits incentives, NFT utility and then create a sustainable subDAO for the project in the long run, to show the Blockchain use        case. 


 ## Value Proposition
     
   **Companies**

## HOW IPFS IS USED
Data is also another crucial aspect we'll be looking to leverage on, so that we will be able to create incentives to collect and recycle plastics sustainably for organizations, individuals and the community at large. We plan on utilizing the IPFS protocol for the storage of this data to ensure enhanced security, control and transparency.

## TECHNICAL PART
The **FuchaNft** contract is mainly tested on local blockchain environments and on testnets, the files(snapshots and img) were stored on **IPFS** and **Pinata**(in case our ipfs node goes down).
  
  **Issues encountered**
* Theres has been an issue with **opensea testnet goerli** not being able to fully upload the img fully, its believed to be an opensea testnet issue.
