        <h4>REGENERATING CITY SPACES FROM PLASTIC WASTE</h4>
        <p>We plan to address the issue of plastic waste by organizing our first community project assembling and designing sustainable trash “smart” bins for the recycling of PLASTIC.</p>
            <p>FUCHA bins, an abbreviation for Fedha Uchafu, meaning “lucrative waste management” aims to transform plastic waste collected from different areas into eco-bricks for sustainable architecture.</p>
                <p> We will start with a pilot from University of Dar-es-salaam areas for starters, then move to other areas as we progress.</p>

            <p>We believe this initiative will help reduce plastic waste in our environment and get us on our way to contributing towards our SDGs #8, #11 & #13. Data is also another crucial aspect we'll be looking to leverage on so that we will be able to create incentives to collect and recycle plastics sustainably for organizations, individuals and the community at large. We plan on utilizing the IPFS protocol for the storage of this data to ensure enhanced security, control and transparency.
            
            <p>The end goal is for the plastic collected to be recycled into regenerative products, say build classrooms/ shelters, chairs or anything that can be recycled and made out of plastic for a greater cause.</p>
            <p>Chatafisha provides the mechanisms for it to happen, the process can be illustrated as follows 
            
            FUCHA Bins physical designs >>> 3D model converted to NFT for operations & governance >>> collection of plastic >>> data is measured, recorded and valued on IPFS >>> earn plastic credits on chain >>> utility recyclables (e.g. plastic furniture, Eco-bricks)
            
            <p>The University students organize from 5-10 “Go-green champions” who will oversee the stationing of the bins, the recycling process, learn about plastic & carbon credits incentives, NFT utility and then create a sustainable subDAO for the project in the long run, to show the Blockchain use case.</p>
            
            <p>The Bins were made by talented Iron sculptists empowered to show their ability to demonstrate plastic recycling incentives.</p>
            <p> Through CHATAFISHA, they were able to learn the utility of the bins they designed as NFTs on the Blockchain.</p>
